PC*The program counter contains the address of the next instruction
CIR*Current Instruction Register: stores the address of the next instruction currently being executed and decoded
MAR*Memory Address Register holds relevant memory address (to read from or write to)
MDR*Memory Data Register, stores data being transferred to and from memory, acts as a buffer
ALU*Arithmetic and Logic Unit, does all mathematical calculations and makes all logical decisions
Accumulator*A storage register in the ALU that holds data temporarily while the data is processed and before it is transferred to memory
GPU*Graphics Processing Unit - dedicated graphics processor on a graphics card, used to render images stored in the RAM of the graphics card
Multi-core CPU*A CPU with more than one core on the same chip - makes use of parallel processing for optimum efficiency
RAM*Random Access Memory - stores programs and data currently in use. Volatile
ROM*Read Only Memory - holds information which must be permanently in memory eg. BIOS
What are the functions of an operating system?*- Providing a user interface, Memory management, Interrupt service routines, Processor scheduling, Backing store management, Input and output management
What is virtual memory?*A technique that uses a portion of the computer's hard disk as an extension of RAM - swaps files in and out of RAM by a process called disk thrashing
What is a multitasking operating system?*An OS which allows each user to run more than one job at a time
What is an embedded operating system?*An OS on a chip instead of on a hard drive, designed to do simple things adapted for specific hardware/functions
What is a real-time operating system?*Processes data as it comes in - in real time
BIOS*Basic input/output system contains programs to load the hardware, stored in ROM
Device drivers*Utility software used by the operating system to communicate with peripheral devices
Interpreter*Converts a program written in a higher level language into a lower level language and executes it, one line at a time
Compiler*Translates a high-level source program into machine instructions readable by a processor and saves it to disk. The program executes when run
Assembler*Translates an assembly-language program into machine code
ADD*Add the contents of the memory address to the accumulator
SUB*Subtract the contents of the memory address from the accumulator
STAStore the accumulator value in the memory address given
LDA*Load the contents of the given memory address into the accumulator
BRA*Branch- use the address given as the address of the next instruction
BRZ*Branch to the given address if accumulator is zero
BRP*Branch to the given address if the accumulator value is positive (or zero)
INP*Input into the accumulator
OUT*Output contents of the accumulator
HLT*Stops the execution of the program
Lossy Compression*data compression techniques in which some amount of data is lost - redundant information is eliminated
Lossless Compression*a data compression algorithm that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data, no data is lost, file size is still made smaller
Primary Key*A field (or group of fields) that uniquely identifies a given entity in a table
Secondary Key*A field that has some identifying information, but typically does not uniquely identify a record with complete accuracy
Foreign Key*A primary key of one table that appears as an attribute in another table and acts to provide a logical relationship between the two tables
Composite Key*Two or more fields that collectively define the primary key by unique combinations of their values
First Normal Form (1NF)*A table that has a primary key and in which there are no repeating attributes or groups of attributes
Second Normal Form (2NF)*A table in first normal form in which there are no partial dependencies (only relevant if the primary key is a composite primary key)
Third Normal Form (3NF)*A table in 2NF where all attributes are dependent on the key, the whole key and nothing but the key
SELECT*SELECT field(s), FROM table(s), WHERE criteria, ORDER BY ascending/descending
CREATE TABLE*CREATE TABLE name (field datatype)
ACID*Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
Atomicity*Requires that a transaction be processed completely or not at all
Name the three programming constructs*Sequence, branching and iteration
Which two categories of loop is iteration split up into?*Count-controlled and Condition-controlled
Give two advantages of using local variables over global variables*Less memory is used, Self-contained so unaffected by code outside of the subroutine, Take precedence over global variables with the same name
What is the difference between procedures and functions?*Functions must always return a single value while a procedure does not always have to return a value
What does IDE stand for?*Integrated Development Environment
Define an algorithm*A set of instructions used to solve aproblem
What is the purpose of testing?*To identify flaws in the software
